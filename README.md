- **Sentiment Analysis**: Categorizes news articles as Positive, Negative, or Neutral.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Provides insights into how the company's news coverage varies.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts summarized content into Hindi speech.
- **User Interface**: Simple web-based interface using Streamlit or Gradio.
- **API Development**: Frontend and backend communicate via APIs.
- **Deployment**: The application is deployed on Hugging Face Spaces.
